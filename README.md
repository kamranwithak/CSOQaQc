# CSOQaQc
CSO Data Quality Assessment

This is where I will be posting much of my work I do on the CSO project for my Internship with LSAMP at the APL.

In this README I'll provide context for each file pushed to this repository.

##Environment File:
  *cso_obsdata_environment.yml
This is the environment file for all of the notebooks and code that I will be pushing. It will always be up to date if I add anymore packages.

##Raw CSO Data:
  *CSOgeodata.txt
  *CSO_CA.txt
  *CSO_UT.txt
These txt files containing the raw CSO data. They are needed to run many of the Notebooks. CSOgeodata.txt is the entire CSO data set pulled from the database on June 28th, 2021. CSO_CA and CSO_UT are region specific CSO data sets for California and Utah respectively.

##Jupyter Notebooks:
  *CSOQaQcSPRING.ipynb
  *CSOToDo.ipynb
  *CSOZeros.ipynb
These are the notebooks that I have been maintaining and using throughout this internship and research opportunity. CSOQaQcSPRING is the main notebook I used to experiment and get comfortable with the data. It is outdated and very rough. All other notebooks come from the work I did during the Summer of 2021.
